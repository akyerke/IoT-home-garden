# IoT-home-garden

This is a project for the AI, Iot, and Big Data course. For the IoT project the home garden was chosen. 

My project is called “Indoor Garden”. It includes humidifier to maintain moisture level of home plants at the certain level depending on their needs. 

When the moisture level goes down which measured by another sensor located in the plant the motor rotates clockwise 45° to reach the surface of water for the humidifier. As moisture level reaches optimal content a motor rotates anti clockwise 45° to stop the humidifier.

Initially by mistake another model of humidifier was ordered which then had to be connected by USB to the power source and had no connecters for jumpers which decreased its functionality and requested usage of motor. It was planned to use button or coding for another humidifier. The humidifier that is used was fixed to motor and motor works be if and else statements. 

The LCD also depicts the room temperature and humidity level of air. Having three variable measurements (humidity, temperature, water content) we can manage room conditions and turn on and off the humidifier.

The humidifier was very fragile so it was broken immediately, the wires were reconnected by hand and fixed later.
